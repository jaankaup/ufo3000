# UFO3000

UFO3000 project is another attempt to enhance my wgpu graphics/compute engine.
The name ufo3000 might be misleading because this isn't a game. The project is
more like a sandbox project for creating algorithms that my "upcoming" game
might use.

## The list of algorithm that are under development.

- [ ] Marching cubes
- [ ] Noise generator
- [ ] Fast Iterative method 2D
- [ ] Fast Iterative method 3D
- [ ] Radix Sort
- [ ] Sphere Tracer
- [ ] Space filling curves (Morton code, Hilbert, Scan line, Rosenberg-Strong, ...)
